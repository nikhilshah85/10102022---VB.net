1. Class - this is a design to create multiple object
2. classes will have variables, properties and functions
	class is made up of
		Variables
		Properties
		Function
		Constructors
		Events and delegates
		Enums

	-----------------------------------------
Encapsulation
			We need variables for storing data
				This is a vital element(variable)
		we keep this variable as private and apply a wrapper on this
		variables, called property and function
			property will have get and set functions


		Accounts(BankAccount) - accNo, accName, accBalance, accIsActive


Abstraction : Consider only those properties and functions necessary
			for your classes

Inheritance

Polymorphism 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		In the same project = add a new class Employee

			it will have below properties
				empNo
				empName
				empDesignation
				empSalary
				empAvailableLeaves

		Functions - 1 Give Bonus(percentage) - it will return percentage of 					salary

			     2. apply leave (days) - deduct empAvailableLeaves and 				 return	remaining days of leave			


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Objects are creted in on RAM
		Process of getting this object out from RAM and storing it on Disk
			is called - Serialization
		Persist the state of an object to a storage / network is called
		Serialization
		so that object can be recreated

		The opposite of this is called as DeSerialization
